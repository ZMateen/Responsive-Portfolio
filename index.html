        <p2>I am a 21-year-old dreamer who is just trying to make it through life. My favorite color is midnight blue and I absolutly love to read and write. Nothing beats sitting in a nice, quiet spot with a good book and something good to drink. I am the difficult middle child in my family wedged in between an older sister and a younger brother. I am also to be the shortest in my tall person family (yippie for me) since my brother is growing at a rapid rate for his age. I love everything and anything that has to do with superheros, fantasy, or the supernatural. I live up in my own head just coming up with different scenarios in which I could write about. Werewolves are probably my favorite supernatural creature. Morphing into a monster wolf during the 14 day span of a full moon cycle sounds about as amazing as it is terrifying!</p>
        <p3>I love, love, <strong>love</strong> video games! They are a big part of my life and it feels like I can never get enough of them. My dream is to go to E3 some day to see and test play all of the new games coming out soon. I don't have a particular favorite genre, but if it seems fun to me or has a compelling story, I'll be all in to play it. I also have way too many games to count. It's not my fault, I swear! All in all, I'm a pretty laid back kinda woman. I like to go with the flow, picking up new skills, and just living life as it comes. But one day, I would loe to become a really famous author so I can share my love of books with the world.</p2>
